Scientific Python Notes
============

These are all of my notes related to learning how to use python for scientific computing, including `scipy`, `numpy`, etc. I will be updating the notebook(s) regularly.

I **highly** recommend cloning this repository and keeping/modifying/adding you're own notes as well! The *magic* of IPython is in the notebooks interactive ability! Clone this repository, fire up Ipython and open it in your browser to begin playing around. Add new cells to further clarify examples and make notes for yourself! Feel free to add entire sections for new packages you explore!


## Installation
Assuming you've already installed [Continuum's Anaconda](https://store.continuum.io/cshop/anaconda/) Scientific Python distribution on your windows machine, you can just fire up a command prompt and type:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/revolunet/sublimetext-markdown-preview.git
cd scientific-python
ipython notebook
```

Your browser should fire up with the notebook ready for use!


## Notebook Viewer
You can also just *view* the notebook online (not edit/execute) by using the fantastic IPython Notebook Viewer. You can view this specific collection of notebooks by clicking here: [Scientific Python](http://nbviewer.ipython.org/github/diego898/scientific-python/).
